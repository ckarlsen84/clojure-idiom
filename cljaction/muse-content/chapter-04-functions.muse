* Lexical Closures

 which are constructs that allow functions to close
over lexically scoped variables. When this closing over is done to
local variables, they become private to the closure. This makes it a
simple way to hide local state. 


Combining closures with first class functions makes it easy to
implement arbitrary control structures in your code (like while
loops).
